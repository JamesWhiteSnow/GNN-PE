# Datasets

Due to the limitation of upload file size, we cannot upload the Youtube and US Patents datasets (you can find them from this [link](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1WzXp-XGGCD_7EA0rcrxJIA?pwd=aeju)) and we have compressed all other datasets to tar.gz files.

Execute the following commands to decompress dataset files.

```
tar -xzvf <dataset_name>.tar.gz
```
